Privacy on the Line,The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption,"Whitfield Diffie, Susan Eva Landau",9780262042406,UB256.U6 D54 2007,2007,"Telecommunication has never been perfectly secure. The Cold War culture of recordingdevices in telephone receivers and bugged embassy offices has been succeeded by a post-9/11 world ofNSA wiretaps and demands for data retention. Although the 1990s battle for individual and commercialfreedom to use cryptography was won, growth in the use of cryptography has been slow. Meanwhile,regulations requiring that the computer and communication industries build spying into their systemsfor government convenience have increased rapidly. The application of the 1994 CommunicationsAssistance for Law Enforcement Act has expanded beyond the intent of Congress to apply to voice overInternet Protocol (VoIP) and other modern data services; attempts are being made to require ISPs toretain their data for years in case the government wants it; and data mining techniques developedfor commercial marketing applications are being applied to widespread surveillance of thepopulation. In Privacy on the Line, Whitfield Diffie and SusanLandau strip away the hype surrounding the policy debate over privacy to examine the nationalsecurity, law enforcement, commercial, and civil liberties issues. They discuss the social functionof privacy, how it underlies a democratic society, and what happens when it is lost. This updatedand expanded edition revises their original -- and prescient -- discussions of both policy andtechnology in light of recent controversies over NSA spying and other government threats tocommunications privacy.",http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780262042406&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

The history of medical mapping is traced--from its growth in the 19th century during an era of trade and immigration to its renaissance in the 1990s during a new era of globalization.

Software testing,"",Ron Patton,9780672319839,QA76.76.T48 P38 2001,2001,"Software Testing is the book for new or aspiring software testers interested in learning about this crucial part of the software development process. The complexity and size of today's software makes writing bug-free code extremely difficult, even for highly experienced programmers. Couple that with our increasing reliance on software for performing everyday tasks and its pervasiveness in the medical, telecommunications, manufacturing, and financial industries, and a software bug can spell disaster. Quality software can't be created with an ad- hoc, part-time, bug hunt. It requires a methodical and disciplined approach to preventing, finding, and reporting bugs.

Best practices for the formal software testing process,a menu of testing tasks,Rodger Drabick,9780932633583,QA76.76.T48 D73 2004,2004-12-01,"How to Use the Formal Testing Process Model. There is no one true way to test software, so the goal of this book is to provide you with a structure and set of best practices that you can use to develop a formal testing process that fits your needs, and those of your customers, your management, and your organization. You should consider this book as a menu of things you could do, and then establish a set of priorities for what you'll do first, what you'll do second, and so on. As an example, suppose you are working in a test engineering role in a company in which the current practice is that when executive management gets an idea for a new application to add to the software suite your company produces, the following happens: First, management assigns a developer to the task; then, the developer takes the limited input from management and writes code for the application. Thus, in such an environment, the entire requirements and design process is minimized at best, and short-circuited at worst. When code is complete, as far as the developer is concerned (and we'll believe that he or she did some limited unit testing based on an understanding of the requirements), the developer hands the code to the test engineer he or she is most comfortable working with, or to the team leader of testing. This may well be the first time that the folks involved in testing have heard about this new or upgraded application. If you're in the role of testing team leader or test engineer, what good does the model in this book do you? In this specific instance, I'd advise you to look carefully at the Perform Formal Test process (see figure below). Consider which of the five subprocesses (Hold Pretest Meeting,Execute Test, Determine Disposition of Incidents, Hold Posttest Meeting, or Write Test Report) you are currently performing. I suspect that, in the environment I've postulated, your group is only performing the Execute Test and Determine Disposition of Incidents subprocesses. It would not be difficult to start holding pretest and posttest meetings, and these could markedly improve your process. At the pretest meeting, you should ask the developer to describe the unit and integration testing performed and to identify areas of risk. The personnel assigned to testing can then concentrate on these risk areas. In such an environment, there probably hasn't been time to develop a test plan or test design, but what would you base the plan or design on, anyway? Test cases or test procedures will have been developed based on discussions with the developer and the development team lead or manager. These can also be reviewed at the pretest meeting for adequacy. This could turn out to be a long meeting for a complex application. You might want to schedule a test-case and test-procedure review meeting prior to the pretest meeting. Peer reviews of test documentation are always a good idea, and the earlier they can be held, the better the return. As part of the Perform Formal Test process, you should also make sure you have some sort of tool or process in place to record defects discovered in testing, a process to present them to the developers, a process to incorporate the fixes, and a process to regression-test the application to make sure that the fixes work (and, perhaps equally important, that they don't break something else).",http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=9OwJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=9OwJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=9OwJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=9OwJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9OwJAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780932633583&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Attempts to adopt reuse without a sound understanding of the range of issues involved, however, can lead to expensive failure. This book is for those who are wondering whether they should adopt reuse and how, and also to those who have already started to adopt it but are wondering where they may be going wrong and how they could do better. It consistently emphasizes the practical issues that influence success or failure in reuse; and it offers a concise and balanced coverage of the essentials of the subject, rather than going into undue depth or detail on some topics at the expense of others. It occupies the central ground between being on the one hand an academic textbook and on the other hand a cookbook with ready-made recipes for exactly how to do it. The authors have drawn on their extensive experience of reuse and of software process improvement to provide a readable and balanced coverage of the subject. This book is suitable for business executives, software managers and software developers, regardless of whatever kind of software or applications are developed by their organisations, and whatever the size of those organisations. A special feature of the book is the frequent use of experience notes, drawn from the real-life experience of organisations that have embarked on the reuse adventure.",http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=kIlpuK1GkLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=kIlpuK1GkLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=kIlpuK1GkLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=kIlpuK1GkLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kIlpuK1GkLwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781852335021&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Software product-line engineering,a family-based software development process,"David M. Weiss, Chi Tau Robert Lai",9780201694383,QA76.76.D47 W545 1999,1999,"Software Product Line Engineering presents a breakthrough in software engineering: the Family-oriented Abstraction, Specification, and Translation (FAST) process. Developed at Lucent Technologies, FAST enables developers to build families of systems faster, more reliably, and more cost-effectively. Using FAST, developers can systematically identify the characteristics each related system has in common, and then specify each new member simply by how it varies from the others. The book begins with a detailed introduction to FAST, and the key challenges of enterprise development it is intended to address. Next, discover how to define a software family, identify abstractions common to the family, create a process for producing new family members, and translate descriptions of family members into high-level language code.

The authors also introduce a new process modeling approach for FAST design, called Process and Artifact State Transition Abstractions (PASTA) -- a full graphical language that offers a roadmap through the FAST development process.

Extreme Programming Explored,"",William C. Wake,9780201733976,QA76.76.D47 W34 2002,2001,"Extreme Programming (XP) is a phenomenon. It promises developers unprecedented efficiency and quality -- and it's delivering on that promise. In this book, Bill Wake doesn't just explain XP to developers who are new to it: he shows how to personally apply the XP best practices that have been identified by leading-edge practitioners. This new book emerged from a series of Bill Wake's essays intended to help XP newbies understand and personally apply XP. Wake covers each key tenet of XP development, including the central role of developers, programming in pairs, direct communication with customers, and continual testing. The book's pragmatic, hands-on approach is reinforced with supporting Java code, concrete examples, and extensive war stories. Along the way, Wake addresses major objections to adopting XP, and introduces new XP best practices that allow organizations to introduce XP far more rapidly and successfully.

The Software Project Manager's Bridge to Agility,"","Michele Sliger, Stacia Broderick",9780321502759,QA76.76.D47 S563 2008,2008,"When software development teams move to agile methods, experienced project managers often struggle—doubtful about the new approach and uncertain about their new roles and responsibilities. In this book, two long-time certified Project Management Professionals (PMPRs) and Scrum trainers have built a bridge to this dynamic new paradigm. They show experienced project managers how to successfully transition to agile by refocusing on facilitation and collaboration, not “command and control.” The authors begin by explaining how agile works: how it differs from traditional “plan-driven” methodologies, the benefits it promises, and the real-world results it delivers. Next, they systematically map the Project Management Institute’s classic, methodology-independent techniques and terminology to agile practices. They cover both process and project lifecycles and carefully address vital issues ranging from scope and time to cost management and stakeholder communication. Finally, drawing on their own extensive personal experience, they put a human face on your personal transition to agile--covering the emotional challenges, personal values, and key leadership traits you’ll need to succeed. Coverage includes Relating the PMBOKR Guide ideals to agile practices: similarities, overlaps, and differences Understanding the role and value of agile techniques such as iteration/release planning and retrospectives Using agile techniques to systematically and continually reduce risk Implementing quality assurance (QA) where it belongs: in analysis, design, defect prevention, and continuous improvement Learning to trust your teams and listen for their discoveries Procuring, purchasing, and contracting for software in agile, collaborative environments Avoiding the common mistakes software teams make in transitioning to agile Coordinating with project management offices and non-agile teams “Selling” agile within your teams and throughout your organization For every project manager who wants to become more agile.

The Unified Modeling Language,Reference Manual,"James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch",9780321245625,QA76.76.D47 R86 2005,2005,"“If you are a serious user of UML, there is no other book quite like this one. I have been involved with the UML specification process for some time, but I still found myself learning things while reading through this book—especially on the changes and new capabilities that have come with UML.” —Ed Seidewitz, Chief Architect, IntelliData Technologies Corporation The latest version of the Unified Modeling Language—UML 2.0—has increased its capabilities as the standard notation for modeling software-intensive systems. Like most standards documents, however, the official UML specification is difficult to read and navigate. In addition, UML 2.0 is far more complex than previous versions, making a thorough reference book more essential than ever. In this significantly updated and expanded edition of the definitive reference to the standard, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and Grady Booch—the UML’s creators—clearly and completely describe UML concepts, including major revisions to sequence diagrams, activity models, state machines, components, internal structure of classes and components, and profiles. Whether you are capturing requirements, developing software architectures, designing implementations, or trying to understand existing systems, this is the book for you. Highlights include: Alphabetical dictionary of articles covering every UML concept Integrated summary of UML concepts by diagram type Two-color diagrams with extensive annotations in blue Thorough coverage of both semantics and notation, separated in each article for easy reference Further explanations of concepts whose meaning or purpose is obscure in the original specifications Discussion sections offering usage advice and additional insight into tricky concepts Notation summary, with references to individual articles A hyperlinked version of the book in Adobe Reader format on CD-ROM, an excellent resource for browsing or searching the text for specific information An enhanced online index available on the book’s web site allowing readers to quickly and easily search the entire text for specific topics The result is an indispensable resource for anyone who needs to understand the inner workings of the industry standard modeling language.",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780321245625&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Software Project Management,A Unified Framework,Walker Royce,9780201309584,QA76.76.D47 R69 1998,1998,"Software Project Managementpresents a new management framework uniquely suited to the complexities of modern software development. Walker Royce's pragmatic perspective exposes the shortcomings of many well-accepted management priorities and equips software professionals with state of the art knowledge derived from his twenty years of successful from the trenches project management experience. This book provides a clear and provocative discussion of the economics, metrics, and management strategies needed to plan and execute a software project successfully. Royce discusses--with refreshing candor--some of the fads, follies, and excesses of the software industry, clearly differentiating proven techniques from obsolete methods. Paired with this insightful examination are compelling arguments for new management approaches that are sure to stimulate debate. The relative impacts of these new techniques are quantified through simple economic analyses, common sense, and anecdotal evidence. The resulting framework strikes a pragmatic balance between theory and practice that can be readily applied in today's challenging development environment. An extensive case study analysis of a large-scale, million-line project--deployed successfully on schedule and under budget using these techniques--further illustrates their application. Software Project Managementprovides the software industry with field-proven benchmarks for making tactical decisions and strategic choices that will enhance an organization's probability of success. This book includes: Top ten principles for modern software management Strategies for smoothly transitioning an organization to modern processes and technologies (such as Rational's Unified process) Methods for keeping software engineering teams motivated and effectively prioritized Insight into the impacts of technology, people, and economics on managing a project Metrics and forecasting guidance for project costs, schedules, and quality control 0201309580B04062001",http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201309584&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

It demonstrates the strategic use of logic in software design, helping you achieve the benefits of formal methods without dramatically changing the way your developers work. Everyone who builds complex information systems uses conceptual software models, but most software designers have only an informal, parochial understanding of the logic beneath these models. This book introduces lightweight uses of applied logic that add welcome precision to software design, without compromising your ability to interpret the models you create. Robertson and Agusti introduce and use key concepts of predicate logic and automation of inference. Based on these concepts, they introduce the use of formal models in lifecycles; techniques for communicating formal theories; the reuse of design paradigms; and more. Unlike most books on formal methods,  they focus extensively on pragmatic considerations, showing how logic can be used to extend (not replace) the modeling methods you already use.",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=jK1QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=jK1QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=jK1QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=jK1QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jK1QAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201398199&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

Applying domain-driven design and patterns,with examples in C# and .NET,Jimmy Nilsson,9780321268204,QA76.76.D47 N645 2006,2006-05-18,"[This] is a book about design in the .NET world, driven in an agile manner and infused with the products of the enterprise patterns community. [It] shows you how to begin applying such things as TDD, object relational mapping, and DDD to .NET projects...techniques that many developers think are the key to future software development.... As the technology gets more capable and sophisticated, it becomes more important to understand how to use it well. This book is a valuable step toward advancing that understanding. Martin Fowler, AUTHOR of Refactoring and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture Patterns, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) enable architects and developers to create systems that are powerful, robust, and maintainable. Now, there's a comprehensive, practical guide to leveraging all these techniques primarily in Microsoft .NET environments, but the discussions are just as useful for Java developers. Drawing on seminal work by Martin Fowler (Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture) and Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design), Jimmy Nilsson shows how to create real-world architectures for any .NET application. Nilsson illuminates each principle with clear, well-annotated code examples based on C# 1.1 and 2.0. His examples and discussions will be valuable both to C# developers and those working with other .NET languages and any databaseseven with other platforms, such as J2EE.

Software Craftsmanship,The New Imperative,Pete McBreen,9780201733860,QA76.76.D47 M386 2002,2002,"By recognizing that software development is not a mechanical task, you can create better applications. Today’s software development projects are often based on the traditional software engineering model, which was created to develop large-scale defense projects. Projects that use this antiquated industrial model tend to take longer, promise more, and deliver less. As the demand for software has exploded, the software engineering establishment has attempted to adapt to the changing times with short training programs that teach the syntax of coding languages. But writing code is no longer the hard part of development; the hard part is figuring out what to write. This kind of know-how demands a skilled craftsman, not someone who knows only how to pass a certification course. Software Craftsmanship presents an alternative—a craft model that focuses on the people involved in commercial software development. This book illustrates that it is imperative to turn from the technology-for-its-own-sake model to one that is grounded in delivering value to customers. The author, Pete McBreen, presents a method to nurture mastery in the programmer, develop creative collaboration in small developer teams, and enhance communications with the customer. The end result—skilled developers who can create, extend, and enhance robust applications. This book addresses the following topics, among others: Understanding customer requirements Identifying when a project may go off track Selecting software craftsmen for a particular project Designing goals for application development Managing software craftsmen Software Craftsmanship is written for programmers who want to become exceptional at their craft and for the project manager who wants to hire them. 0201733862B07242001",http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780201733860&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Waltzing With Bears,Managing Risk on Software Projects,"Tom DeMarco, Timothy R. Lister",9780932633606,QA76.76.D47 D4755 2003,2003-01-01,"Winner of the Software Development Jolt Product Excellence Award Greater risk brings greater reward, especially in software development. A company that runs away from risk will soon find itself lagging behind its more adventurous competition. By ignoring the threat of negative outcomes—in the name of positive thinking or a can-do attitude—software managers drive their organizations into the ground. In Waltzing with Bears, Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister—the best-selling authors of Peopleware—show readers how to identify and embrace worthwhile risks. Developers are then set free to push the limits. The authors present the benefits of risk management, including that it • makes aggressive risk-taking possible • protects management from getting blindsided • provides minimum-cost downside protection • reveals invisible transfers of responsibility • isolates the failure of a subproject. Readers are armed with strategies for confronting the most common risks that software projects face: • schedule flaws • requirements inflation • turnover • specification breakdown • and under-performance. Waltzing with Bears will help you mitigate the risks—before they turn into project-killing problems. Risks are out there—and they should be there—but there is a way to manage them. Insights from the Book Running away from risk is a no-win proposition. Sometimes you come across a project that looks positively risk-free. In the past, you may have looked at such an endeavor as a 'slam dunk' and thanked your lucky stars to be given an easy project for a change. We've had the same reaction. What dummies we were. Those projects weren't worth doing at all. - from Chapter 1",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=6qNQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=6qNQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=6qNQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=6qNQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6qNQAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780932633606&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

With this book, you will learn to: Flexible, quick and practical requirements that workSave time and develop better software that meets users' needsGathering user stories -- even when you can't talk to usersHow user stories work, and how they differ from use cases, scenarios, and traditional requirementsLeveraging user stories as part of planning, scheduling, estimating, and testingIdeal for Extreme Programming, Scrum, or any other agile methodology---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thoroughly reviewed and eagerly anticipated by the agile community, User Stories Applied offers a requirements process that saves time, eliminates rework, and leads directly to better software. The best way to build software that meets users' needs is to begin with user stories: simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users. In User Stories Applied, Mike Cohn provides you with a front-to-back blueprint for writing these user stories and weaving them into your development lifecycle. You'll learn what makes a great user story, and what makes a bad one. You'll discover practical ways to gather user stories, even when you can't speak with your users. Then, once you've compiled your user stories, Cohn shows how to organize them, prioritize them, and use them for planning, management, and testing. User role modeling: understanding what users have in common, and where they differ Gathering stories: user interviewing, questionnaires, observation, and workshopsWorking with managers, trainers, salespeople and other proxiesWriting user stories for acceptance testing Using stories to prioritize, set schedules, and estimate release costsIncludes end-of-chapter practice questions and exercises User Stories Applied will be invaluable to every software developer, tester, analyst, and manager working with any agile method: XP, Scrum... or even your own home-grown approach.

In this book, Agile Alliance cofounder Mike Cohn discusses the philosophy of agile estimating and planning and shows you exactly how to get the job done, with real-world examples and case studies. Concepts are clearly illustrated and readers are guided, step by step, toward how to answer the following questions: What will we build? How big will it be? When must it be done? How much can I really complete by then? You will first learn what makes a good plan-and then what makes it agile. Using the techniques in Agile Estimating and Planning , you can stay agile from start to finish, saving time, conserving resources, and accomplishing more. Highlights include: Why conventional prescriptive planning fails and why agile planning works How to estimate feature size using story points and ideal days–and when to use each How and when to re-estimate How to prioritize features using both financial and nonfinancial approaches How to split large features into smaller, more manageable ones How to plan iterations and predict your team's initial rate of progress How to schedule projects that have unusually high uncertainty or schedule-related risk How to estimate projects that will be worked on by multiple teams Agile Estimating and Planning supports any agile, semiagile, or iterative process, including Scrum, XP, Feature-Driven Development, Crystal, Adaptive Software Development, DSDM, Unified Process, and many more.

Weber, Bill Curtis, Mary Beth Chrissis In every sense, the CMM represents the best thinking in the field today... this book is targeted at anyone involved in improving the software process, including members of assessment or evaluation teams, members of software engineering process groups, software managers, and software practitioners... From the Foreword by Watts Humphrey The Capability Maturity Model for Software (CMM) is a framework that demonstrates the key elements of an effective software process. The CMM describes an evolutionary improvement path for software development from an ad hoc, immature process to a mature, disciplined process, in a path laid out in five levels. When using the CMM, software professionals in government and industry can develop and improve their ability to identify, adopt, and use sound management and technical practices for delivering quality software on schedule and at a reasonable cost. This book provides a description and technical overview of the CMM, along with guidelines for improving software process management overall. It is a sequel to Watts Humphrey's important work,Managing the Software Process,in that it structures the maturity framework presented in that book more formally.

Drawing upon the experiences of hundreds of developers he has trained or worked with, Kirk Knoernschild offers a systematic guide to solving today's complex problems of Java-based enterprise application design and implementation. Knoernschild focuses on both technology and process, offering a phased approach to integrating UML, object-oriented development, and Java TM throughout the entire development lifecycle. Knoernschild begins by reintroducing objects and object-oriented design, presenting key concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance in terms of several powerful principles and patterns that inform the entire book. Next, he introduces the UML: how it evolved, the problems it helps to solve, and how various UML constructs can be mapped to Java. Knoernschild shows how to structure UML diagrams to more easily identify the problem being solved, introduces best practices that any software development process should promote, and shows how the UML fits with these best practices. He reviews the external considerations that impact how companies really use the UML, Java TM, and object-based techniques, presenting a pragmatic, phased approach to integrating them with the least pain and the greatest effectiveness.

Developing Enterprise Java Applications with J2EE and UML,"","Khawar Zaman Ahmed, Cary E. Umrysh",9780201738292,QA76.73.J38 A35 2002,2002,"The Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE TM) offers great promise for dramatically improving the way that enterprise applications are built, and organizations that have adopted the J2EE are gaining a competitive advantage. The industry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) has helped countless organizations achieve software success through visual modeling. Together, the UML and J2EE form a powerful set of tools, but the intricacies involved with using them in tandem are considerable. While UML is highly effective for specifying, designing, constructing, visualizing, and documenting software systems, J2EE offers enterprise developers a simplified, component-based approach to application development. However, when using the two technologies together, developers must first consider--and attempt to reconcile--the different characteristics of each. Developing Enterprise Java Applications with J2EE TM and UML examines the best ways to jointly leverage these technologies. Exploring concrete methods for completing a successful development project, the authors cover the use of UML and J2EE in detail. Using practical examples and a case study, they illustrate the pros and cons of specific design approaches, show how personal experience can affect design decisions, and demonstrate proven approaches for building better, software faster. With this book as a guide, developers will be able to overcome the challenges in using UML and J2EE together, and be on their way to building robust, scalable, and complex applications. 0201738295B09042001",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780201738292&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Effective STL,50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of the Standard Template Library,Scott Meyers,9780201749625,QA76.73.C153 M49 2001,2001,"“This is Effective C++ volume three – it’s really that good.” – Herb Sutter, independent consultant and secretary of the ISO/ANSI C++ standards committee “There are very few books which all C++ programmers must have. Add Effective STL to that list.” – Thomas Becker, Senior Software Engineer, Zephyr Associates, Inc., and columnist, C/C++ Users Journal C++’s Standard Template Library is revolutionary, but learning to use it well has always been a challenge. Until now. In this book, best-selling author Scott Meyers ( Effective C++ , and More Effective C++ ) reveals the critical rules of thumb employed by the experts – the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing – to get the most out of the library. Other books describe what’s in the STL. Effective STL shows you how to use it. Each of the book’s 50 guidelines is backed by Meyers’ legendary analysis and incisive examples, so you’ll learn not only what to do, but also when to do it – and why. Highlights of Effective STL include: Advice on choosing among standard STL containers (like vector and list), nonstandard STL containers (like hash_set and hash_map), and non-STL containers (like bitset). Techniques to maximize the efficiency of the STL and the programs that use it. Insights into the behavior of iterators, function objects, and allocators, including things you should not do. Guidance for the proper use of algorithms and member functions whose names are the same (e.g., find), but whose actions differ in subtle (but important) ways. Discussions of potential portability problems, including straightforward ways to avoid them. Like Meyers’ previous books, Effective STL is filled with proven wisdom that comes only from experience.

Beyond The C++ Standard Library,An Introduction To Boost,Björn Karlsson,9780321133540,QA76.73.C153 K365 2006,2006,"Introducing the Boost libraries: the next breakthrough in C++ programming Boost takes you far beyond the C++ Standard Library, making C++ programming more elegant, robust, and productive. Now, for the first time, a leading Boost expert systematically introduces the broad set of Boost libraries and teaches best practices for their use. Writing for intermediate-to-advanced C++ developers, Björn Karlsson briefly outlines all 58 Boost libraries, and then presents comprehensive coverage of 12 libraries you're likely to find especially useful. Karlsson's topics range from smart pointers and conversions to containers and data structures, explaining exactly how using each library can improve your code. He offers detailed coverage of higher-order function objects that enable you to write code that is more concise, expressive, and readable. He even takes you behind the scenes with Boost, revealing tools and techniques for creating your own generic libraries. Coverage includes Smart pointers that provide automatic lifetime management of objects and simplify resource sharing Consistent, best-practice solutions for performing type conversions and lexical conversions Utility classes that make programming simpler and clearer Flexible container libraries that solve common problems not covered by the C++ Standard Library Powerful support for regular expressions with Boost.Regex Function objects defined at the call site with Boost.Bind and Boost.Lambda More flexible callbacks with Boost.Function Managed signals and slots (a.k.a. the Observer pattern) with Boost.Signals The Boost libraries are proving so useful that many of them are planned for inclusion in the next version of the C++ Standard Library.

Drawn from the ACM/SIGPLAN Second History of Programming Languages Conference, this volume, like the earlier book from the first such conference (HOPL), conveys the motivations of the language designers and the reasons why they rejected existing languages and created new ones. The book relates the processes by which different languages evolved, in the words of the individuals active in the languages' development. Most important, participants share insights about influences and decisions, both on choices made and on the many roads not taken. In the book's conclusion, distinguished historians of computing share views about preserving programming language history. Fourteen chapters cover a broad range of languages in wide use today, as well as lesser known languages that made significant contributions to programming language evolution: C, C++, Smalltalk, Pascal, Ada, Prolog, Lisp, ALGOL 68, FORMAC, CLU, Icon, Forth, Monitors and Concurrent Pascal, and Discrete Simulation Languages.

Generative Programming (GP) offers the promise of moving from one-of-a-kind software systems to the semi-automated manufacture of wide varieties of software -- essentially, an assembly line for software systems. GP's goal is to model software system families and build software modules such that, given particular requirements specs, highly customized and optimized intermediate or end products can be constructed on demand. This is the first book to cover Generative Programming in depth. The authors, leaders in their field, introduce the two-stage GP development cycle: one stage for designing and implementing a generative domain model, and another for using the model to build concrete systems. They review key differences between generative modeling and processes used for one-of-a-kind systems. Next, they introduce key GP concepts such as feature models, and demonstrate generic programming techniques for creating components which lend themselves to easy combination and reuse. The book also introduces Aspect Oriented Programming, which allows developers to solve key recurring problems in traditional O-O development; and presents metaprogramming techniques for building powerful program generators.

It contains every trick I knew plus many, many more. A godsend for library developers, compiler writers, and lovers of elegant hacks, it deserves a spot on your shelf right next to Knuth. --Josh Bloch When I first saw the title, I figured that the book must be either a cookbook for breaking into computers (unlikely) or some sort of compendium of little programming tricks. It's the latter, but it's thorough, almost encyclopedic, in its coverage. --Guy Steele These are the timesaving techniques relished by computer hackers--those devoted and persistent code developers who seek elegant and efficient ways to build better software. The truth is that much of the computer programmer's job involves a healthy mix of arithmetic and logic. In Hacker's Delight , veteran programmer Hank Warren shares the tricks he has collected from his considerable experience in the worlds of application and system programming. Most of these techniques are eminently practical, but a few are included just because they are interesting and unexpected. The resulting work is an irresistible collection that will help even the most seasoned programmers better their craft. Topics covered include: A broad collection of useful programming tricks Small algorithms for common tasks Power-of-2 boundaries and bounds checking Rearranging bits and bytes Integer division and division by constants Some elementary functions on integers Gray code Hilbert's space-filling curve And even formulas for prime numbers! This book is for anyone who wants to create efficient code.

Good programming involves the systematic mastery of complexity, and this book provides the first unified treatment of the techniques of abstraction and specification, which, the authors argue, are the linchpin of any effective approach to programming. They place particular emphasis on the use of data abstraction to produce highly modular programs.The authors focus on the process of decomposing large program projects into independent modules that can be assigned to independent working groups. They discuss methods of decomposition, the kinds of modules that are most useful in this process, and techniques to increase the likelihood that modules produced can in fact be recombined to solve the original programming problem. There are many examples of abstractions throughout the text, and each chapter ends with pertinent references and exercises.Most of the sample implementations in the book are written in CLU, one of a growing number of languages able to support data abstraction. Sufficient material is included, however, to allow the reader to work in Pascal as well.The material in this book was developed by the authors during a decade of teaching undergraduate, graduate, and professional-level courses. Barbara Liskov, the developer of CLU, is Professor and John Guttag an Associate Professor of Computer Science at MIT. Abstraction and Specification in Program Development is included in the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science series.",http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=CbRQAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=CbRQAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=CbRQAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=CbRQAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CbRQAAAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780262121125&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process. This approach fosters a variety of skills--critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail--that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers.The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks.All the book's support materials are available for free on the Web.

Directing his materials to the computer programmer with at least one year of experience, Gries presents explicit principles behind program development, and then leads the reader through example programs using those principles.

The techniques are used in major avionics and electronics companies worldwide, and are automated by most major CASE tools. Large software-based systems, especially those for real-time applications, require multi-mode operation, direct interaction with a rapidly changing physical environment, and fast response times. In the past, the development of such systems was prone to massive cost and schedule overruns, and to inadequate performance and reliability.

Aesthetic computing,"",Paul A. Fishwick,9780262062503,QA76.5 A3393 2006,2006-04-01,"In Aesthetic Computing, key scholars and practitioners from art, design, computer science, and mathematics lay the foundations for a discipline that applies the theory and practice of art to computing. Aesthetic computing explores the way art and aesthetics can play a role in different areas of computer science. One of its goals is to modify computer science by the application of the wide range of definitions and categories normally associated with making art. For example, structures in computing might be represented using the style of Gaudi or the Bauhaus school. This goes beyond the usual definition of aesthetics in computing, which most often refers to the formal, abstract qualities of such structures—a beautiful proof, or an elegant diagram. The contributors to this book discuss the broader spectrum of aesthetics—from abstract qualities of symmetry and form to ideas of creative expression and pleasure—in the context of computer science. The assumption behind aesthetic computing is that the field of computing will be enriched if it embraces all of aesthetics. Human-computer interaction will benefit—usability, for example, could refer to improving a user's emotional state—and new models of learning will emerge. Aesthetic Computing approaches its subject from a variety of perspectives. After defining the field and placing it in its historical context, the book looks at art and design, mathematics and computing, and interface and interaction. Contributions range from essays on the art of visualization and the poesy of programming to discussions of the aesthetics of mathematics throughout history and transparency and reflectivity in interface design.

The dotCrime manifesto,how to stop Internet crime,Phillip Hallam-Baker,9780321503589,HV6773 H35 2008,2008,"Internet crime keeps getting worse...but it doesn't have to be that way. In this book, Internet security pioneer Phillip Hallam-Baker shows how we can make the Internet far friendlier for honest people–and far less friendly to criminals. The dotCrime Manifestobegins with a revealing new look at the challenge of Internet crime–and a surprising look at today's Internet criminals. You'll discover why the Internet's lack of accountability makes it so vulnerable, and how this can be fixed –technically, politically, and culturally. Hallam-Baker introduces tactical, short-term measures for countering phishing, botnets, spam, and other forms of Internet crime. Even more important, he presents a comprehensive plan for implementing accountability-driven security infrastructure: a plan that draws on tools that are already available, and rapidly emerging standards and products. The result: a safer Internet that doesn't sacrifice what people value most: power, ubiquity, simplicity, flexibility, or privacy. Tactics and strategy: protecting Internet infrastructure from top to bottom Building more secure transport, messaging, identities, networks, platforms, and more Gaining safety without sacrificing the Internet's unique power and value Making the Internet safer for honest people without sacrificing ubiquity, simplicity, or privacy Spam: draining the swamp, once and for all Why spam contributes to virtually every form of Internet crime–and what we can do about it Design for deployment: how to really make it happen Defining security objectives, architecture, strategy, and design–and evangelizing them How to Build a Safer, Better Internet You'll find yourself deeply concerned, then fascinated, then hopeful as you read about  Building an Internet that resists online crime  Phishing, botnets, and spam: tactical, workable, immediate countermeasures  Establishing the “Accountable Web”: a strategic, long-term solution to Internet crime  Improving security without sacrificing what people love about the Internet The Internet is today's Wild West: too much lawlessness, too little accountability. Now, one of the Internet's leading pioneers shows how we can build a more trustworthy Internet: one that resists crime without frustrating honest people or compromising privacy and civil liberties. Drawing on years at the cutting edge of Internet and security research, Phillip Hallam-Baker offers a complete plan for reinventing the Internet: a plan that addresses everything from technology to politics and culture. Whether you're a technology professional, policymaker, or citizen, this book will show you how we can make the Internet better, smarter, and above all, safer. informit.com/aw Preface xix Acknowledgments xxiv About the Author xxviii Chapter 1: Motive 1 Chapter 2: Famous for Fifteen Minutes 37 Chapter 3: Learning from Mistakes 51 Chapter 4: Making Change Happen 81 Chapter 5: Design for Deployment 107 Chapter 6: Spam Whack-a-Mole 119 Chapter 7: Stopping Spam 135 Chapter 8: Stopping Phishing 155 Chapter 9: Stopping Botnets 175 Chapter 10: Cryptography 199 Chapter 11: Establishing Trust 215 Chapter 12: Secure Transport 227 Chapter 13: Secure Messaging 251 Chapter 14: Secure Identity 277 Chapter 15: Secure Names 311 Chapter 16: Secure Networks 323 Chapter 17: Secure Platforms 343 Chapter 18: Law 355 Chapter 19: The dotCrime Manifesto 377 Further Reading 383 References 387 Index 395",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=xTMgAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=xTMgAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=xTMgAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=xTMgAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xTMgAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780321503589&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Introduction to computer security,"",Matthew A. Bishop,9780321247445,QA76.9.A25 B563 2005,2005,"In this authoritative book, widely respected practitioner and teacher Matt Bishop presents a clear and useful introduction to the art and science of information security. Bishop's insights and realistic examples will help any practitioner or student understand the crucial links between security theory and the day-to-day security challenges of IT environments. Bishop explains the fundamentals of security: the different types of widely used policies, the mechanisms that implement these policies, the principles underlying both policies and mechanisms, and how attackers can subvert these tools--as well as how to defend against attackers.

Architecture is crucial to the success of any large software system -- but even a superb architecture will fail if it isn't communicated well. Now, there's a language- and notation-independent guide to capturing architecture so it can be used successfully by every analyst, software designer, and developer. The authors review the diverse goals and uses of software architecture documentation, providing documentation strategies for several common scenarios. They identify the basic unit of software architecture documentation: the viewtype, which specifies the type of information to be provided in an architectural view. For each viewtype -- Modules, Component-and-Connectors, and Allocation -- they offer detailed guidance on documenting what really matters. Next, they demonstrate how to package architecture documentation in coherent, usable form: augmenting architectural views with documentation of interfaces and behavior; accounting for architectural variability and dynamic systems; and more.",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780201703726&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Use cases are a simple, straightforward -- yet very powerful -- way to express the functional requirements (or behaviors) of a system. Use cases have gained widespread acceptance because they make requirements less ambiguous by specifying exactly when and under what conditions certain behaviors occur. As a result, those who effective employ use cases to model their systems can better deliver projects on time, within budget, and with fewer defects. However, use case modeling is not that easy; it is a practice that comes with characteristics that can impact a project. In this new book, the authors allow you to benefit from their considerable experience making use cases work well in a number of different environments. With the advice, tips, and tricks presented herein, the reader will be further along the path to understanding and exploiting the power of use cases, and ultimately constructing better applications.

Process for system architecture and requirements engineering,"","Derek J. Hatley, Peter Hruschka, Imtiaz A.

Process for System Architecture and Requirements Engineering introduces a new approach that is particularly useful for multidisciplinary system development: It applies equally well to all technologies and thereby provides a common language for developers in widely differing disciplines. The Hatley/Hruschka/Pirbhai approach (H/H/P) has another important feature: the coexistence of the requirements and architecture methods and of the corresponding models they produce. These two models are kept separate, but the approach fully records their ongoing and changing interrelationships. This feature is missing from virtually all other system and software development methods and from CASE tools that only automate the requirements model. System managers, system architects, system engineers, and managers and engineers in all of the diverse engineering technologies will benefit from this comprehensive, pragmatic text. In addition to its models of requirements and architecture and of the development process itself, the book uses in-depth case studies of a hospital's patient-monitoring system and of a multidisciplinary groundwater analysis system to illustrate the principles.",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=eazsVPsnyeMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=eazsVPsnyeMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=eazsVPsnyeMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=eazsVPsnyeMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=eazsVPsnyeMC&dq=isbn:9780932633415&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

However, integrating them offers stiff challenges that are not well understood by most software practitioners, and there have been many spectacular failures. Now, a team of authors from the Software Engineering Institute draws upon the lessons presented by both the failures and the successes, offering a start-to-finish methodology for integrating commercial components successfully. The authors examine failed integration projects, identifying key lessons and early warning signs, including the failure to account for loss of control over engineering design and production. Drawing upon both successes and failures, they present proven solutions for establishing requirements, evaluating components, creating flexible system designs that incorporate commercial components; and managing multiple concurrent design options linked to external market events and feasibility proofs.

Event-driven software development divides the software system into highly cohesive, highly-independent partitions based on business events. This book helps developers, analysts and architects understand the strategy, in-depth, so they can use it to accelerate analysis. Readers will learn how to understand systems from multiple viewpoints, reflect user requirements more effectively, and model systems through a selective, iterative, and parallel approach that promotes easy prototying and early, low-cost error repair. Coverage includes: an insightful discussion of the nature of business events and their impact of the development lifecycle; specific event-driven methods and techniques for analyzing, specifying, and modeling information systems; a close look at function-point estimating; and techniques for partitioning responses to business events across object classes. To illustrate the book's key techniques, a detailed case study is presented.

The topics flow naturally and easily, explanatory code fragments are inserted in very logical places to illustrate concepts, and all in all, this book makes an excellent tutorial as well as a reference. —John Carey, Chief Technology Officer, C.O.R.E. Feature Animation OpenGL® Shading Language, Second Edition, extensively updated for OpenGL 2.0, is the experienced application programmer's guide to writing shaders. Part reference, part tutorial, this book thoroughly explains the shift from fixed-functionality graphics hardware to the new era of programmable graphics hardware and the additions to the OpenGL API that support this programmability. With OpenGL and shaders written in the OpenGL Shading Language, applications can perform better, achieving stunning graphics effects by using the capabilities of both the visual processing unit and the central processing unit. In this book, you will find a detailed introduction to the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and the new OpenGL function calls that support it. The text begins by describing the syntax and semantics of this high-level programming language. Once this foundation has been established, the book explores the creation and manipulation of shaders using new OpenGL function calls. OpenGL® Shading Language, Second Edition, includes updated descriptions for the language and all the GLSL entry points added to OpenGL 2.0; new chapters that discuss lighting, shadows, and surface characteristics; and an under-the-hood look at the implementation of RealWorldz, the most ambitious GLSL application to date.

Developing Business Systems with CORBA,"","Waqar Sadiq, Fred Cummins",9780521649995,QA76.76.C66 A43 1998,1998,"This ground-breaking book distills the experience of the authors in dealing with problems in industry that can be solved by using the SELECT Perspective. A pragmatic, component-based approach for the development of enterprise systems, the SELECT Perspective comprises a unique blend of techniques, architecture, and process. Enterprise software development presents challenges of sheer scale and complexity that continue to accelerate at a terrific pace. Businesses are becoming increasingly adaptive and are calling for software that is more and more flexible. Component technology holds the promise of solving these problems, but there are some complications. For example, many organizations continue to struggle with the challenge of integrating their legacy systems with the newer technology. The approach in this book offers a streamlined set of modeling techniques based on Unified Modeling Language (UML); uses a serviced-based architecture that provides an overall design philosophy for reusable software that addresses the needs of the business, not the technology; and is a clearly defined software process that provides guidance on how to employ the knowledge base of available techniques.",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780521649995&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api
Invasive Software Composition,"",Uwe Aßmann,9783540443858,QA76.76.C66 A26 2003,2003-02-27,"Invasive software composition as a new, component-based way to construct software systems is presented. To improve reuse, this method regards software components as greybox and integrates them during composition. Components are distinct in design, but are merged in implementations, leading to highly integrated and more efficient systems. Building on a minimal set of program transformations, composition operator libraries can be developed that parameterize, extend, connect, mediate, and aspect-weave components. Invasive software composition unifies several software engineering techniques such as generic programming, architecture systems, inheritance, and aspect-oriented programming. The book is centered around the JAVA language and a freely available demonstrator library called COMPOST.

Constantine--who originally created structured design to effect such improvement--now joins with well-known consultant Lucy A. D. Lockwood to turn the focus of software development to the external architecture. In this book, they present the models and methods of a revolutionary approach to software that will help programmers deliver more usable software--software that will enable users to accomplish their tasks with greater ease and efficiency. Recognizing usability as the key to successful software, Constantine and Lockwood provide concrete tools and techniques that programmers can employ to meet that end. Much more than just another set of rules for good user-interface design, this book guides readers through a systematic software development process. This process, called usage-centered design, weaves together two major threads in software development methods: use cases (also used with UML) and essential modeling. With numerous examples and case studies of both conventional and specialized software applications, the authors illustrate what has been shown in practice to work and what has proved to be of greatest practical value.

Practical Software Engineering,A Case Study Approach,"Leszek A. Maciaszek, Bruce Lee Liong",9780321204653,QA76.758 M248 2005,2005,"The distinctive character of this book stems from two endeavors. First, this book is about the way software engineering is done in practice. Second, it is about software engineering for enterprise applications. Enterprise applications include payroll, patient records, shipping tracking, cost analysis, credit scoring, insurance, supply chain, accounting, customer service, and foreign exchange trading. Enterprise applications dont include automobile fuel injection, word processors, elevator controllers, chemical plant controllers, telephone switches, operating systems, compilers, and games. (Fowler, 2003, p.3). The book is pivoted on one main case-study, a large number of supporting examples, and end-of-chapter problem-solving exercises consisting of case-study exercises and minicases. A particular organization that the case-study, problem-solving exercises and most examples are derived from is a company specializing in advertising expenditure measurement. The book endeavors to give broad software engineering knowledge and to provide background information prior to presenting case-study solutions. However, a distinguishing emphasis of the book is to concentrate on support skills for system design and programming. For given requirements, the book iteratively develops design and implementation models. Case-study, examples and problem-solving exercises are carefully selected to emphasize various aspects of software development as necessitated by unique characteristics of different applications and target software solutions. The book consists of four parts. Part A (Software projects) discusses software lifecycle, software engineering tools, project planning, budgeting and scheduling, project quality, risk management, and change management. The next three parts (B, C, and D) concentrate on methods, techniques, processes, and development environments of software engineering. The case-study, examples and problem-solving exercises are based on the experience gained from a large ACNielsen project. For pedagogical reasons, industrial problems and solutions have been simplified and re-implemented specifically for the purpose of the book.

TSP,Coaching Development Teams,Watts S. Humphrey,9780201731132,QA76.758 H8627 2006,2006,"Most modern software development projects require teams, and good teamwork largely determines a project’s success. The Team Software Process (TSP), created by Watts S. Humphrey, is a set of engineering practices and team concepts that produce effective teams, thereby helping developers deliver high-quality products on time and within budget. TSP bridges Humphrey’s seminal work on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), an improvement framework for the entire software organization, and his Personal Software Process (PSP), practices designed to improve the work of individual developers. Typical first-time TSP teams increase productivity by more than 50 percent while greatly increasing the quality of their delivered products. However, TSP teams only continue to improve under the guidance of a capable coach. One industrial-strength team, for example, increased its productivity by an additional 94 percent and reduced test defects by 85 percent through three consecutive TSP quarterly product release cycles. Without competent coaching, teams often do not progress much beyond the initial one-time improvement seen after the introduction of the TSP. Humphrey distinguishes between TSP coaching and TSP leadership, explaining why the skillful performance of both functions is critical. In this practical guide, he shares coaching methods that have repeatedly inspired TSP teams and steered them toward success. With the help of a coach, TSP teams undergo a brief but intense project launch in which they define their own processes, make their own plans, and negotiate their commitments with management, resulting in dramatically enhanced performance. Whether you are considering the TSP or are actively implementing it, TSPSM—Coaching Development Teams provides the invaluable examples, guidelines, and suggestions you need to get started and keep developing as a team coach. It’s meant to complement Humphrey’s other books, TSPSM—Leading a Development Team and PSPSM: A Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers. Together, the three works offer a rich resource for improving your software development capabilities.",http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201731132&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

A Discipline for Software Engineering,"",Watts S Humphrey,9780201546101,QA76.758 H857 1995,1995,"This new work from Watts Humphrey, author of the influential book, Managing the Software Process, broadens his orderly view of software process management, and lays the foundation for a disciplined approach to software engineering. In his earlier book, the author developed concrete methods for managing software development and maintenance. These methods, now commonly practiced in industry, provide programmers and managers with specific steps they can take to evaluate and improve their software capabilities. In this new book, Humphrey scales those methods down to a personal level, helping software engineers develop the skills and habits needed to plan, track, and analyze large, complex projects. Humphrey and others have used material from this book to train professionals and students around the world in a projects-oriented software engineering course. First establishing the need for discipline in software engineering, and the benefits to practitioners of learning how to manage their personal software process, Humphrey then develops a model that they can use to monitor, test, and improve their work.

With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time. The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks'central argument in The Mythical Man-Month:that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of lab∨ that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks'view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper No Silver Bullet; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, There will be no silver bullet within ten years.",http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201835953&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Learning Python,"","Mark Lutz, David Ascher",9781565924642,QA76.73.P98 L877 1999,1999,"Python is an object-oriented language for writing standalone programs, quick scripts, and prototypes of complex applications. Python is free, open source, and easy to use. Python scripts are portable across many platforms, including all major Unix systems, Linux, Windows 95/98, Windows NT, and MacOS. Already widely used on Unix and Linux platforms, Python's clean interface to Windows application object models makes it an attractive scripting language for Windows programmers. JPython, a version of Python designed to work with the Java programming language, also makes Python an attractive tool in the Java environment. Learning Python is the perfect introduction to this increasingly popular scripting language. Written by two leading Python trainers, this book covers the core concepts of the language. Each chapter contains many examples and ends with a set of exercises. Because Python can be run interactively, the reader can run the examples and exercises on any system where Python is installed. Suggested solutions to all the exercises are in the back of the book, making it an excellent teaching and leaming tool. This book provides a description of the basic building blocks of a Python program : types, operators, statements, functions, modules, classes, and exceptions. In addition, the book introduces more advanced topics, including some complex, real-world examples. Finally, it shows programmers how to use Python with specialized libraries to build large-scale applications, including a substantial program written in JPython. For simple scripts or complex scientific, web, database, graphics, and animation programs, Python is proving to be a powerful and convenient tool. With Learning Python, programmers can learn to use this language quickly and efficiently.",http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781565924642&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Program Development in Java,"Abstraction, Specification, and Object-Oriented Design","Barbara Liskov, John V. Guttag",9780201657685,QA76.73.J38 L58 2000,2001,"Written by a world-renowned expert on programming methodology, and the winner of the 2008 Turing Award, this book shows how to build production-quality programs--programs that are reliable, easy to maintain, and quick to modify. Its emphasis is on modular program construction: how to get the modules right and how to organize a program as a collection of modules. The book presents a methodology effective for either an individual programmer, who may be writing a small program or a single module in a larger one; or a software engineer, who may be part of a team developing a complex program comprised of many modules. Both audiences will acquire a solid foundation for object-oriented program design and component-based software development from this methodology. Because each module in a program corresponds to an abstraction, such as a collection of documents or a routine to search the collection for documents of interest, the book first explains the kinds of abstractions most useful to programmers: procedures; iteration abstractions; and, most critically, data abstractions. Indeed, the author treats data abstraction as the central paradigm in object-oriented program design and implementation. The author also shows, with numerous examples, how to develop informal specifications that define these abstractions--specifications that describe what the modules do--and then discusses how to implement the modules so that they do what they are supposed to do with acceptable performance. Other topics discussed include: Encapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the behavior defined by the specification Tradeoffs between simplicity and performance Techniques to help readers of code understand and reason about it, focusing on such properties as rep invariants and abstraction functions Type hierarchy and its use in defining families of related data abstractions Debugging, testing, and requirements analysis Program design as a top-down, iterative process, and design patterns The Java programming language is used for the book's examples. However, the techniques presented are language independent, and an introduction to key Java concepts is included for programmers who may not be familiar with the language.",http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201657685&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Japan's Software Factories,A Challenge to U.S. Management,Michael A. Cusumano,9780195062168,HD9696.C63 J3134 1991,1991,"Though Japan has successfully competed with U.S. companies in the manufacturing and marketing of computer hardware, it has been less successful in developing computer programs. This book contains the first detailed analysis of how Japanese firms have tried to redress this imbalance by applying their skills in engineering and production management to software development. Cusumano focuses on the creation of software factories in which large numbers of people are engaged in developing software in cooperative ways--i.e. individual programs are not developed in isolation but rather utilize portions of other programs already developed whenever possible, and then yield usable portions for other programs being written. Devoting chapters to working methods at System Developing Corp., Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, and Fujitsu, and including a comparison of Japanese and U.S. software factories, Cusumano's book will be important reading for all people involved in software and computer technology, as well as those interested in Japanese business and corporate culture.",http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=E-L6mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=E-L6mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=E-L6mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=E-L6mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=E-L6mAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780195062168&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api
