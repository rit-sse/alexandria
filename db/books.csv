Privacy on the Line,The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption,"Whitfield Diffie, Susan Eva Landau",9780262042406,UB256.U6 D54 2007,2007,"Telecommunication has never been perfectly secure. The Cold War culture of recordingdevices in telephone receivers and bugged embassy offices has been succeeded by a post-9/11 world ofNSA wiretaps and demands for data retention. Although the 1990s battle for individual and commercialfreedom to use cryptography was won, growth in the use of cryptography has been slow. Meanwhile,regulations requiring that the computer and communication industries build spying into their systemsfor government convenience have increased rapidly. The application of the 1994 CommunicationsAssistance for Law Enforcement Act has expanded beyond the intent of Congress to apply to voice overInternet Protocol (VoIP) and other modern data services; attempts are being made to require ISPs toretain their data for years in case the government wants it; and data mining techniques developedfor commercial marketing applications are being applied to widespread surveillance of thepopulation. In Privacy on the Line, Whitfield Diffie and SusanLandau strip away the hype surrounding the policy debate over privacy to examine the nationalsecurity, law enforcement, commercial, and civil liberties issues. They discuss the social functionof privacy, how it underlies a democratic society, and what happens when it is lost. This updatedand expanded edition revises their original -- and prescient -- discussions of both policy andtechnology in light of recent controversies over NSA spying and other government threats tocommunications privacy.",http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nMY8yHaTQi4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780262042406&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

The history of medical mapping is traced--from its growth in the 19th century during an era of trade and immigration to its renaissance in the 1990s during a new era of globalization.

Attempts to adopt reuse without a sound understanding of the range of issues involved, however, can lead to expensive failure. This book is for those who are wondering whether they should adopt reuse and how, and also to those who have already started to adopt it but are wondering where they may be going wrong and how they could do better. It consistently emphasizes the practical issues that influence success or failure in reuse; and it offers a concise and balanced coverage of the essentials of the subject, rather than going into undue depth or detail on some topics at the expense of others. It occupies the central ground between being on the one hand an academic textbook and on the other hand a cookbook with ready-made recipes for exactly ""how to do it"""". The authors have drawn on their extensive experience of reuse and of software process improvement to provide a readable and balanced coverage of the subject. This book is suitable for business executives", software managers and software developers, regardless of whatever kind of software or applications are developed by their organisations, and whatever the size of those organisations. A special feature of the book is the frequent use of experience notes," drawn from the real-life experience of organisations that have embarked on the reuse adventure.""",http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=kIlpuK1GkLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api

The costs that this can save you, from management, maintenance and server consolidation are very significant.” -YAACOV COHEN chief executive officer, Mainsoft “A complete and up-to-date coverage of Java EE .NET security interoperability standards and related specifications.” -HUBERT A. LE VAN GONG architect, Sun Microsystems, and the coauthor of “Web SSO MEX Specification” Evolving Web services standards and technologies offer limited interoperability when it comes to security, management, and other important application characteristics. Successful interoperability solutions require comprehensive integration strategies that go beyond simple connections. The capability to mitigate security and reliability risks and transactional support is critical to interoperability.

XML developers desperately need mature software development processes and tools for developing effective applications. David Carlson fills the gap, showing exactly how to leverage the worldwide UML standard for modeling complex systems in advanced XML development. In Modeling XML Applications with UML, he presents the first comprehensive framework for modeling communications in any B2B software system. Carlson presents in-depth coverage of UML-based analysis, design, and modeling of XML content within e-Business environments. The book includes detailed coverage of using UML to support the creation of new XML-based B2B vocabularies and industry portals that reflect the requirements of several key stakeholder communities, including consumers, business analysts, web application specialists, system integration specialists, and content developers. Carlson presents several B2B use cases, and then decomposes them into scenarios illustrated with class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams showing how XML fits into an overall e-Business solution. Each chapter concludes with ""steps for success"""" that distill UML's general principles into specific recommendations for action.""",http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=AbFQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=AbFQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=AbFQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=AbFQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AbFQAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201709155&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Developed at Lucent Technologies, FAST enables developers to build families of systems faster, more reliably, and more cost-effectively. Using FAST, developers can systematically identify the characteristics each related system has in common, and then specify each new member simply by how it varies from the others. The book begins with a detailed introduction to FAST, and the key challenges of enterprise development it is intended to address. Next, discover how to define a software family, identify abstractions common to the family, create a process for producing new family members, and translate descriptions of family members into high-level language code. You'll learn how to predict the types of changes new software will require, and organize development and maintenance accordingly. The authors also introduce a new process modeling approach for FAST design, called Process and Artifact State Transition Abstractions (PASTA) -- a full graphical language that offers a roadmap through the FAST development process. Together, FAST and PASTA enable you to leverage the latest research in domain engineering and software design to streamline the entire process of creating software systems.",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=721YAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=721YAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=721YAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=721YAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=721YAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201694383&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

It promises developers unprecedented efficiency and quality -- and it's delivering on that promise. In this book, Bill Wake doesn't just explain XP to developers who are new to it: he shows how to personally apply the XP best practices that have been identified by leading-edge practitioners. This new book emerged from a series of Bill Wake's essays intended to help XP newbies understand and personally apply XP. Wake covers each key tenet of XP development, including the central role of developers, programming in pairs, direct communication with customers, and continual testing. The book's pragmatic, hands-on approach is reinforced with supporting Java code, concrete examples, and extensive war stories. Along the way, Wake addresses major objections to adopting XP, and introduces new XP ""best practices"""" that allow organizations to introduce XP far more rapidly and successfully.

In this book, two long-time certified Project Management Professionals (PMPRs) and Scrum trainers have built a bridge to this dynamic new paradigm. They show experienced project managers how to successfully transition to agile by refocusing on facilitation and collaboration, not “command and control.” The authors begin by explaining how agile works: how it differs from traditional “plan-driven” methodologies, the benefits it promises, and the real-world results it delivers. Next, they systematically map the Project Management Institute’s classic, methodology-independent techniques and terminology to agile practices. They cover both process and project lifecycles and carefully address vital issues ranging from scope and time to cost management and stakeholder communication. Finally, drawing on their own extensive personal experience, they put a human face on your personal transition to agile--covering the emotional challenges, personal values, and key leadership traits you’ll need to succeed. Coverage includes Relating the PMBOKR Guide ideals to agile practices: similarities, overlaps, and differences Understanding the role and value of agile techniques such as iteration/release planning and retrospectives Using agile techniques to systematically and continually reduce risk Implementing quality assurance (QA) where it belongs: in analysis, design, defect prevention, and continuous improvement Learning to trust your teams and listen for their discoveries Procuring, purchasing, and contracting for software in agile, collaborative environments Avoiding the common mistakes software teams make in transitioning to agile Coordinating with project management offices and non-agile teams “Selling” agile within your teams and throughout your organization For every project manager who wants to become more agile.

The unified modeling language reference manual,,"James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch",9780321245625,QA76.76.D47 R86 2005,2005,"“If you are a serious user of UML, there is no other book quite like this one. I have been involved with the UML specification process for some time, but I still found myself learning things while reading through this book-especially on the changes and new capabilities that have come with UML.” - Ed Seidewitz, Chief Architect, IntelliData Technologies Corporation The latest version of the Unified Modeling Language-UML 2.0-has increased its capabilities as the standard notation for modeling software-intensive systems. Like most standards documents, however, the official UML specification is difficult to read and navigate. In addition, UML 2.0 is far more complex than previous versions, making a thorough reference book more essential than ever. In this significantly updated and expanded edition of the definitive reference to the standard, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and Grady Booch-the UML's creators-clearly and completely describe UML concepts, including major revisions to sequence diagrams, activity models, state machines, components, internal structure of classes and components, and profiles. Whether you are capturing requirements, developing software architectures, designing implementations, or trying to understand existing systems, this is the book for you. Highlights include: Alphabetical dictionary of articles covering every UML concept Integrated summary of UML concepts by diagram type Two-color diagrams with extensive annotations in blue Thorough coverage of both semantics and notation, separated in each article for easy reference Further explanations of concepts whose meaning or purpose is obscure in the original specifications Discussion sections offering usage advice and additional insight into tricky concepts Notation summary, with references to individual articles A hyperlinked version of the book in Adobe Reader format on CD-ROM, an excellent resource for browsing or searching the text for specific information An enhanced online index available on the book's web site allowing readers to quickly and easily search the entire text for specific topics The result is an indispensable resource for anyone who needs to understand the inner workings of the industry standard modeling language.",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0a5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780321245625&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Software project management,a unified framework,Walker Royce,9780201309584,QA76.76.D47 R69 1998,1998,"(Fra anmeldelse på Amazon.com): If you aren't versed in advanced project management techniques this book will be overwhelming. More important you may pick up misleading information. However, if you are a battle-scared veteran of software development projects and have a full understanding of earned value project management, estimating techniques and development life cycles you'll learn much from this book. The highlights are: project life cycle and process framework that is [obviously] closely aligned to the Rational Unified Process (RUP), and can be fitted to any rapid development or iterative approach. An excellent tutorial on effective project controls, with an emphasis on earned value project management. In-depth coverage of estimating techniques, with a lot of material on the constructive cost model (CoCoMo), and current gaps in estimating techniques and to where the craft and science of estimating and software economics needs to evolve in the discussion of next-generation cost models. I especially like his distinction between the use of source lines of code metrics for size and function points for scale. There is middle ground. The treasure trove of metrics, including core project metrics, and the change metrics that are given in Appendix C. There is one glaring flaw in this book and an experienced project manager will quickly spot it: the proposed approach to basing work breakdown structures on project phases instead of the decomposition of the system to be delivered will not work. Using Royce's approach there is no clear way of integrating the work breakdown structure with the organizational breakdown structure. Using earned value techniques (which is well covered elsewhere in the book) Royce's approach will not align control accounts (sometimes called cost accounts), making his recommendations contrived and unworkable.",http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=O3kZAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201309584&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Pattern-oriented software architecture,a system of patterns,Frank Buschmann,9780471958697,QA76.76.D47 P376 1996,1996-10-08,"Pattern - Oriented Software Architecture A System of Patterns Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert, Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal of Siemens AG, Germany Pattern-oriented software architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

Software Craftsmanship,The New Imperative,Pete McBreen,9780201733860,QA76.76.D47 M386 2002,2002,"By recognizing that software development is not a mechanical task, you can create better applications. Today’s software development projects are often based on the traditional software engineering model, which was created to develop large-scale defense projects. Projects that use this antiquated industrial model tend to take longer, promise more, and deliver less. As the demand for software has exploded, the software engineering establishment has attempted to adapt to the changing times with short training programs that teach the syntax of coding languages. But writing code is no longer the hard part of development; the hard part is figuring out what to write. This kind of know-how demands a skilled craftsman, not someone who knows only how to pass a certification course. Software Craftsmanship presents an alternative—a craft model that focuses on the people involved in commercial software development. This book illustrates that it is imperative to turn from the technology-for-its-own-sake model to one that is grounded in delivering value to customers. The author, Pete McBreen, presents a method to nurture mastery in the programmer, develop creative collaboration in small developer teams, and enhance communications with the customer. The end result—skilled developers who can create, extend, and enhance robust applications. This book addresses the following topics, among others: Understanding customer requirements Identifying when a project may go off track Selecting software craftsmen for a particular project Designing goals for application development Managing software craftsmen Software Craftsmanship is written for programmers who want to become exceptional at their craft and for the project manager who wants to hire them. 0201733862B07242001",http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=C9vvHV1lIawC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780201733860&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

However, Extreme Programming contradicts many of the traditional beliefs in software development; therefore, many professionals hate it. Either way, potential adopters and opponents need to make decisions on Extreme Programming. In Questioning Extreme Programming, author Pete McBreen puts this agile approach to application development under the microscope, and closely examines both sides of this heated debate.",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=fnphQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=fnphQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=fnphQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=fnphQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fnphQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201844573&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Traditional software development methods struggle to keep pace with the accelerated pace and rapid change of Internet-era development. Several ""agile methodologies"""" have been developed in response -- and these approaches to software development are showing exceptional promise. In this book", Jim Highsmith covers them all -- showing what they have in common, where they differ, and how to choose and customize the best agile approach for your needs. Highsmith begins by introducing the values and principles shared by virtually all agile software development methods. He presents detailed case studies from organizations that have used them, as well as interviews with each method's principal authors or leading practitioners. Next, he takes a closer look at the key features and techniques associated with each major Agile approach: Extreme Programming (XP)

Kerth guides readers through productive, empowering retrospectives of project performance. Whether your shop calls them postmortems or postpartums or something else, project retrospectives offer organizations a formal method for preserving the valuable lessons learned from the successes and failures of every project. These lessons and the changes identified by the community will foster stronger teams and savings on subsequent efforts. For a retrospective to be effective and successful, though, it needs to be safe. Kerth shows facilitators and participants how to defeat the fear of retribution and establish an air of mutual trust. One tool is Kerth's Prime Directive: Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. Applying years of experience as a project retrospective facilitator for software organizations, Kerth reveals his secrets for managing the sensitive, often emotionally charged issues that arise as teams relive and learn from each project. Don't move on to your next project without consulting and using this readable, practical handbook. Each member of your team will be better prepared for the next deadline.",http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks7.books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780932633408&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Design and use of software architectures,adopting and evolving a product-line approach,Jan Bosch,9780201674941,QA76.76.D47 B69 2000,2000,"-- Designing software architectures that maximize reuse and flexibility. -- Leveraging software architectures across product lines and families. -- Includes detailed, real-world case studies. Sophisticated development organizations worldwide are discovering the advantages of software architectures in building systems that deliver higher quality, lower development and maintenance costs, and shorter time to market. In this book, one of the field's leading experts addresses the two most important factors in making software architectures work: effective design, and leveraging architectures across product lines. Jan Bosch begins by outlining the rationale for software architectures, and reviewing the limits of traditional approaches to software reuse. Next, Bosch introduces a comprehensive approach to software architecture design that includes explicit quality goals, is carefully optimized up front, and still accounts for the inevitability of change. In Part II, Bosch presents today's best practices for defining architectures that can be reused across entire ""lines"""" or """"families"""" of software. Bosch covers each phase of the software product line lifecycle", including development, usage, and evolution of software assets, showing how to manage interdependencies," and cope with new requirements that were not part of the original design. The book includes several running case studies from real companies that have achieved competitive advantage through software architecture."""

The industry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) has helped countless organizations achieve software success through visual modeling. Together, the UML and J2EE form a powerful set of tools, but the intricacies involved with using them in tandem are considerable. While UML is highly effective for specifying, designing, constructing, visualizing, and documenting software systems, J2EE offers enterprise developers a simplified, component-based approach to application development. However, when using the two technologies together, developers must first consider--and attempt to reconcile--the different characteristics of each. Developing Enterprise Java Applications with J2EE TM and UML examines the best ways to jointly leverage these technologies. Exploring concrete methods for completing a successful development project, the authors cover the use of UML and J2EE in detail. Using practical examples and a case study, they illustrate the pros and cons of specific design approaches, show how personal experience can affect design decisions, and demonstrate proven approaches for building better, software faster. With this book as a guide, developers will be able to overcome the challenges in using UML and J2EE together, and be on their way to building robust, scalable, and complex applications. 0201738295B09042001",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UNBGpSiLbnsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780201738292&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Now, for the first time, a leading Boost expert systematically introduces the broad set of Boost libraries and teaches best practices for their use. Writing for intermediate-to-advanced C++ developers, Bj rn Karlssonbriefly outlines all 58 Boost libraries, and then presents comprehensive coverage of 12 libraries you're likely to find especially useful. Karlsson's topics range from smart pointers and conversions to containers and data structures, explaining exactly how using each library can improve your code. He offers detailed coverage of higher-order function objects that enable you to write code that is more concise, expressive, and readable. He even takes you ""behind the scenes"""" with Boost", revealing tools and techniques for creating your own generic libraries. Coverage includes Smart pointers that provide automatic lifetime management of objects and simplify resource sharing Consistent, best-practice solutions for performing type conversions and lexical conversions Utility classes that make programming simpler and clearer Flexible container libraries that solve common problems not covered by the C++ Standard Library Powerful support for regular expressions with Boost.Regex Function objects defined at the call site with Boost.Bind and Boost.Lambda More flexible callbacks with Boost.Function Managed signals and slots (a.k.a. the Observer pattern) with Boost.Signals The Boost libraries are proving so useful that many of them are planned for inclusion in the next version of the C++ Standard Library.

Drawn from the ACM/SIGPLAN Second History of Programming Languages Conference, this volume, like the earlier book from the first such conference (HOPL), conveys the motivations of the language designers and the reasons why they rejected existing languages and created new ones. The book relates the processes by which different languages evolved, in the words of the individuals active in the languages' development. Most important, participants share insights about influences and decisions, both on choices made and on the many roads not taken. In the book's conclusion, distinguished historians of computing share views about preserving programming language history. Fourteen chapters cover a broad range of languages in wide use today, as well as lesser known languages that made significant contributions to programming language evolution: C, C++, Smalltalk, Pascal, Ada, Prolog, Lisp, ALGOL 68, FORMAC, CLU, Icon, Forth, Monitors and Concurrent Pascal, and Discrete Simulation Languages.

Using Executable UML (xUML), developers can build UML models that can not only be unambiguously interpreted by human readers, but can be tested and validated through actual execution, and ultimately translated directly and completely to target code. This technology offers immense potential for accelerating development projects, enhancing reliability, and reducing cost. In this book, two of the field's leading experts introduce every facet of xUML. The authors introduce Executable UML's goals, premises, and features; then drill down to explain its key elements. Along the way, readers will discover exactly how to use xUML to create software systems that can be tested even before they are coded, enabling far greater reliability at significantly lower expense.

Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process. This approach fosters a variety of skills--critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail--that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers.The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks.All the book's support materials are available for free on the Web. The Web site includes the environment, teacher guides, exercises for all levels, solutions, and additional projects.",http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=Eg1Tu9Ds8ugC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=Eg1Tu9Ds8ugC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=Eg1Tu9Ds8ugC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=Eg1Tu9Ds8ugC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Eg1Tu9Ds8ugC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780262062183&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Directing his materials to the computer programmer with at least one year of experience", Gries presents explicit principles behind program development, and then leads the reader through example programs using those principles.

The book introduces the widely implemented Hatley/Pirbhai methods, a major extension of the DeMarco analysis method describing how external events control the system's operating behavior. The techniques are used in major avionics and electronics companies worldwide, and are automated by most major CASE tools. Large software-based systems, especially those for real-time applications, require multi-mode operation, direct interaction with a rapidly changing physical environment, and fast response times. In the past, the development of such systems was prone to massive cost and schedule overruns, and to inadequate performance and reliability. Strategies for Real-Time System Specification addresses these problems by integrating a finite-state machine structure into classical analysis methods.

Aesthetic computing,,Paul A. Fishwick,9780262062503,QA76.5 A3393 2006,2006-04-01,"In Aesthetic Computing, key scholars and practitioners from art, design, computer science, and mathematics lay the foundations for a discipline that applies the theory and practice of art to computing. Aesthetic computing explores the way art and aesthetics can play a role in different areas of computer science. One of its goals is to modify computer science by the application of the wide range of definitions and categories normally associated with making art. For example, structures in computing might be represented using the style of Gaudi or the Bauhaus school. This goes beyond the usual definition of aesthetics in computing, which most often refers to the formal, abstract qualities of such structures—a beautiful proof, or an elegant diagram. The contributors to this book discuss the broader spectrum of aesthetics—from abstract qualities of symmetry and form to ideas of creative expression and pleasure—in the context of computer science. The assumption behind aesthetic computing is that the field of computing will be enriched if it embraces all of aesthetics. Human-computer interaction will benefit—""usability", for example, could refer to improving a user's emotional state—and new models of learning will emerge. Aesthetic Computing approaches its subject from a variety of perspectives. After defining the field and placing it in its historical context, the book looks at art and design, mathematics and computing," and interface and interaction. Contributions range from essays on the art of visualization and """"the poesy of programming"""" to discussions of the aesthetics of mathematics throughout history and transparency and reflectivity in interface design.

The dotCrime Manifesto,How to Stop Internet Crime,Phillip Hallam-Baker,9780321503589,HV6773 H35 2008,2007-12-29,"Internet crime keeps getting worse...but it doesn’t have to be that way. In this book, Internet security pioneer Phillip Hallam-Baker shows how we can make the Internet far friendlier for honest people—and far less friendly to criminals. The dotCrime Manifesto begins with a revealing new look at the challenge of Internet crime—and a surprising look at today’s Internet criminals. You’ll discover why the Internet’s lack of accountability makes it so vulnerable, and how this can be fixed —technically, politically, and culturally. Hallam-Baker introduces tactical, short-term measures for countering phishing, botnets, spam, and other forms of Internet crime. Even more important, he presents a comprehensive plan for implementing accountability-driven security infrastructure: a plan that draws on tools that are already available, and rapidly emerging standards and products. The result: a safer Internet that doesn’t sacrifice what people value most: power, ubiquity, simplicity, flexibility, or privacy. Tactics and strategy: protecting Internet infrastructure from top to bottom Building more secure transport, messaging, identities, networks, platforms, and more Gaining safety without sacrificing the Internet’s unique power and value Making the Internet safer for honest people without sacrificing ubiquity, simplicity, or privacy Spam: draining the swamp, once and for all Why spam contributes to virtually every form of Internet crime—and what we can do about it Design for deployment: how to really make it happen Defining security objectives, architecture, strategy, and design—and evangelizing them",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ZWp-1R_tJGgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ZWp-1R_tJGgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ZWp-1R_tJGgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ZWp-1R_tJGgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWp-1R_tJGgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780321503589&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Bishop's insights and realistic examples will help any practitioner or student understand the crucial links between security theory and the day-to-day security challenges of IT environments. Bishop explains the fundamentals of security: the different types of widely used policies, the mechanisms that implement these policies, the principles underlying both policies and mechanisms, and how attackers can subvert these tools--as well as how to defend against attackers. A practicum demonstrates how to apply these ideas and mechanisms to a realistic company. Coverage includes Confidentiality, integrity, and availability Operational issues, cost-benefit and risk analyses, legal and human factors Planning and implementing effective access control Defining security, confidentiality, and integrity policies Using cryptography and public-key systems, and recognizing their limits Understanding and using authentication: from passwords to biometrics Security design principles: least-privilege, fail-safe defaults, open design, economy of mechanism, and more Controlling information flow through systems and networks Assuring security throughout the system lifecycle Malicious logic: Trojan horses, viruses, boot sector and executable infectors, rabbits, bacteria, logic bombs--and defenses against them Vulnerability analysis, penetration studies, auditing, and intrusion detection and prevention Applying security principles to networks, systems, users, and programs Introduction to Computer Securityis adapted from Bishop's comprehensive and widely praised book, Computer Security: Art and Science.This shorter version of the original work omits much mathematical formalism, making it more accessible for professionals and students who have a less formal mathematical background, or for readers with a more practical than theoretical interest.",http://bks6.books.google.com/books?id=Z-lQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks6.books.google.com/books?id=Z-lQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks6.books.google.com/books?id=Z-lQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks6.books.google.com/books?id=Z-lQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-lQAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780321247445&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

In this book, Chris Britton offers IT architects and decision-makers practical start-to-finish guidance for defining architectures and choosing middleware strategies that integrate the entire enterprise, maximizing flexibility, resiliency, scalability, security, and manageability. IT Architectures and Middleware gives IT professionals expert guidance for identifying key architectural issues, and building complex distributed systems with confidence and foresight. Rather than focusing on a specific technology such as COM, CORBA, or Enterprise Java Beans, Chris Britton starts with the realities of IT in the enterprise: its massive size and accelerating growth rates. Britton helps system architects rise above the hype and evade the vendor crossfire, presenting a quick survey of middleware technology, and offering guidance on the IT structures and middleware technologies most likely to address their business requirements.

Architecture is crucial to the success of any large software system -- but even a superb architecture will fail if it isn't communicated well. Now, there's a language- and notation-independent guide to capturing architecture so it can be used successfully by every analyst, software designer, and developer. The authors review the diverse goals and uses of software architecture documentation, providing documentation strategies for several common scenarios. They identify the basic unit of software architecture documentation: the viewtype, which specifies the type of information to be provided in an architectural view. For each viewtype -- Modules, Component-and-Connectors, and Allocation -- they offer detailed guidance on documenting what really matters. Next, they demonstrate how to package architecture documentation in coherent, usable form: augmenting architectural views with documentation of interfaces and behavior; accounting for architectural variability and dynamic systems; and more.",http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=none&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ASc9HYPkr4sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780201703726&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Use cases are a simple, straightforward -- yet very powerful -- way to express the functional requirements (or behaviors) of a system. Use cases have gained widespread acceptance because they make requirements less ambiguous by specifying exactly when and under what conditions certain behaviors occur. As a result, those who effective employ use cases to model their systems can better deliver projects on time, within budget, and with fewer defects. However, use case modeling is not that easy; it is a practice that comes with characteristics that can impact a project. In this new book, the authors allow you to benefit from their considerable experience making use cases work well in a number of different environments. With the advice, tips, and tricks presented herein, the reader will be further along the path to understanding and exploiting the power of use cases, and ultimately constructing better applications.

Process for System Architecture and Requirements Engineering introduces a new approach that is particularly useful for multidisciplinary system development: It applies equally well to all technologies and thereby provides a common language for developers in widely differing disciplines. The Hatley/Hruschka/Pirbhai approach (H/H/P) has another important feature: the coexistence of the requirements and architecture methods and of the corresponding models they produce. These two models are kept separate, but the approach fully records their ongoing and changing interrelationships. This feature is missing from virtually all other system and software development methods and from CASE tools that only automate the requirements model. System managers, system architects, system engineers, and managers and engineers in all of the diverse engineering technologies will benefit from this comprehensive, pragmatic text.

This book answers the key questions underlying today's dramatic shift towards component-based development (CBD): What are we trying to achieve with components, and how can we define and implement components so that we accomplish our goals? It goes beyond identifying the compelling benefits of component-based development, to review the key challenges and obstacles that face designers and developers -- and to present today's best solutions. The author begins by showing why components offer exceptional promise in helping developers cope with the conflicting pressures of cost, schedule, flexibility, and quality. She clearly defines components, compares current component models, shows how components relate to other development techniques, and offers new insight into the ownership, scope, and organizational impact of CBD initiatives. The book includes detailed coverage of software architecture and component definition, addressing key issues such as coarse vs. fine-grained components. It outlines the essential tasks associated with creating and refining an effective CBD strategy; then walks through every aspect of implementation, from planning and organization through acquisition of third-party components, new component design, assembly, testing, certification, and maintenance.

UML components,a simple process for specifying component-based software,"John Cheesman, John Daniels",9780201708516,QA76.76.C66 C48 2001,2001,"Developers using component technologies such as COM+ and Enterprise JavaBeans need to be able to define and express specifications for their components. They can do so using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), whether or not the components are being implemented internally using object technology. However, they also need a simple process that ensures specifications relate correctly to requirements. Although originally conceived as a notation for object-oriented modeling, UML has great potential for component-based systems. ""UML Components"""" applies UML to the world of component architecture", demonstrating how it can be used to specify components, their interactions, and their integration into cohesive systems. This book shows readers which elements of UML apply to server-side component-based development and how to use them most effectively. Following a simple step-by-step process, the authors walk through requirements definition, component identification

A pragmatic, component-based approach for the development of enterprise systems, the SELECT Perspective comprises a unique blend of techniques, architecture, and process. Enterprise software development presents challenges of sheer scale and complexity that continue to accelerate at a terrific pace. Businesses are becoming increasingly adaptive and are calling for software that is more and more flexible. Component technology holds the promise of solving these problems, but there are some complications. For example, many organizations continue to struggle with the challenge of integrating their legacy systems with the newer technology. The approach in this book offers a streamlined set of modeling techniques based on Unified Modeling Language (UML); uses a serviced-based architecture that provides an overall design philosophy for reusable software that addresses the needs of the business, not the technology; and is a clearly defined software process that provides guidance on how to employ the knowledge base of available techniques.",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0gd5PgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780521649995&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

To improve reuse, this method regards software components as greybox and integrates them during composition. Components are distinct in design, but are merged in implementations, leading to highly integrated and more efficient systems. Building on a minimal set of program transformations, composition operator libraries can be developed that parameterize, extend, connect, mediate, and aspect-weave components. Invasive software composition unifies several software engineering techniques such as generic programming, architecture systems, inheritance, and aspect-oriented programming.

Software engineering,,Ian Sommerville,9780201398151,QA76.758 S657 2000,2001,"Software Engineering presents a broad perspective on software systems engineering, concentrating on widely-used techniques for developing large-scale software systems. In seven parts, this best-selling book covers a wide spectrum of software processes from initial requirements elicitation through design and development to system evolution. It supports students taking undergraduate and graduate courses in software engineering and software engineers in industry who need to update their knowledge on new techniques such as requirements engineering, distributed systems architectures and system dependability. Extensive market research has ensured that this new edition is useful and relevant for both students and practising software engineers. The sixth edition has been restructured and updated, important new topics have been added and obsolete material has been cut. The end result is an even more focused book that is about 10% shorter than the previous edition. Changes from the fifth edition - There are new chapters covering software processes, distributed systems architectures, dependability and legacy systems. - Program examples are now in Java and graphical system models are described in the standard UML. - All chapters have been updated and several have been extensively rewritten. Reuse now focuses on component-based development and patterns; object-oriented design has a process focus and uses the UML; the chapters on requirements have been split to cover the requirements themselves and requirements engineering process; cost estimation has been updated to include the COCOMO 2 model. - The chapters on critical systems has been restructured so that reliability, safety, availability and security are integrated in chapters on critical systems specification, development and validation. - The section on formal specification has been cut to a single chapter and material on CASE has been integrated with the chapters covering the processes supported. Functional design has been incorporated in the new chapter on legacy systems. The book's web site (www.software-engin.com) includes links to material to support the use of the book in teaching and personal study. It includes an instructor's manual, overhead transparencies, source code of the program examples and additional material on CASE and formal specification.

Its emphasis is on a case study approach in which a project is developed through the course of the book illustrating the different activities of software development. The sequence of chapters is essentially the same as the sequence of activities performed during a typical software project. All activities, including quality assurance and control activities, are described in each chapter as integral activities for that phase of the development process. Similarly, the author carefully introduces appropriate metrics for controlling and assessing the software process. This book is intended for students who have had no previous training in software engineering and is suitable for a one semester course.

TSP,Coaching Development Teams,Watts S. Humphrey,9780201731132,QA76.758 H8627 2006,2006-04-14,"Most modern software development projects require teams, and good teamwork largely determines a project’s success. The Team Software Process (TSP), created by Watts S. Humphrey, is a set of engineering practices and team concepts that produce effective teams, thereby helping developers deliver high-quality products on time and within budget. TSP bridges Humphrey’s seminal work on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), an improvement framework for the entire software organization, and his Personal Software Process (PSP), practices designed to improve the work of individual developers. Typical first-time TSP teams increase productivity by more than 50 percent while greatly increasing the quality of their delivered products. However, TSP teams only continue to improve under the guidance of a capable coach. One industrial-strength team, for example, increased its productivity by an additional 94 percent and reduced test defects by 85 percent through three consecutive TSP quarterly product release cycles. Without competent coaching, teams often do not progress much beyond the initial one-time improvement seen after the introduction of the TSP. Humphrey distinguishes between TSP coaching and TSP leadership, explaining why the skillful performance of both functions is critical. In this practical guide, he shares coaching methods that have repeatedly inspired TSP teams and steered them toward success. With the help of a coach, TSP teams undergo a brief but intense project launch in which they define their own processes, make their own plans, and negotiate their commitments with management, resulting in dramatically enhanced performance. Whether you are considering the TSP or are actively implementing it, TSPSM—Coaching Development Teams provides the invaluable examples, guidelines, and suggestions you need to get started and keep developing as a team coach. It’s meant to complement Humphrey’s other books, TSPSM—Leading a Development Team and PSPSM: A Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers. Together, the three works offer a rich resource for improving your software development capabilities.",http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ovE9mQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201731132&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

A Discipline for Software Engineering,,Watts S Humphrey,9780201546101,QA76.758 H857 1995,1995,"This new work from Watts Humphrey, author of the influential book, Managing the Software Process, broadens his orderly view of software process management, and lays the foundation for a disciplined approach to software engineering. In his earlier book, the author developed concrete methods for managing software development and maintenance. These methods, now commonly practiced in industry, provide programmers and managers with specific steps they can take to evaluate and improve their software capabilities. In this new book, Humphrey scales those methods down to a personal level, helping software engineers develop the skills and habits needed to plan, track, and analyze large, complex projects. Humphrey and others have used material from this book to train professionals and students around the world in a projects-oriented software engineering course. First establishing the need for discipline in software engineering, and the benefits to practitioners of learning how to manage their personal software process, Humphrey then develops a model that they can use to monitor, test, and improve their work. Examples drawn from industry enhance the practical focus of the book, while project exercises give readers the opportunity to practice software process management as they learn it. Features: presents concepts and methods for a disciplined software engineering process; scales down industrial practices for planning, tracking, analysis, and defect management to fit the needs of small-scale program development; and shows how small project disciplines provide a solid base for larger projects.",http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=e6dQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=e6dQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=e6dQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=e6dQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=e6dQAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201546101&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time. The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks'central argument in The Mythical Man-Month:that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of lab∨ that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks'view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper ""No Silver Bullet""""; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion"," """"There will be no silver bullet within ten years.""""""",http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=fUYPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api

XSLT,,Doug Tidwell,9780596000530,QA76.73.X58 T53 2001,2001-08-23,"XSLT documents a core technology for processing XML. Originally created for page layout, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Transformations) is now much more: a general-purpose translation tool, a system for reorganizing document content, and a way to generate multiple results-- such as HTML, WAP, and SVG--from the same content. What sets XSLT apart from other books on this critical tool is the depth of detail and breadth of knowledge that Doug Tidwell, a developer with years of XSLT experience, brings to his concise treatment of the many talents of XSLT. He covers XSLT and XPath, a critical companion standard, and addresses topics ranging from basic transformations to complex sorting and linking. He explores extension functions on a variety of different XSLT processors and shows ways to combine multiple documents using XSLT. Code examples add a real-world dimension to each technique. Useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it difficult to get started in, and the ability to use advanced techniques depends on a clear and exact understanding of how XSLT templates work and interact. For instance, the understanding of ""variables"""" in XSLT is deeply different from the understanding of """"variables"""" in procedural languages. The author explains XSLT by building from the basics to its more complex and powerful possibilities", so that whether you're just starting out in XSLT or looking for advanced techniques," you'll find the level of information you need.""",http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=21sZgWvE9FoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=21sZgWvE9FoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=21sZgWvE9FoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api

Learning Python,Powerful Object-Oriented Programming,"Mark Lutz, David Ascher",9781565924642,QA76.73.P98 L877 1999,1999,"Python is an object-oriented language for writing standalone programs, quick scripts, and prototypes of complex applications. Python is free, open source, and easy to use. Python scripts are portable across many platforms, including all major Unix systems, Linux, Windows 95/98, Windows NT, and MacOS. Already widely used on Unix and Linux platforms, Python's clean interface to Windows application object models makes it an attractive scripting language for Windows programmers. JPython, a version of Python designed to work with the Java programming language, also makes Python an attractive tool in the Java environment. Learning Python is the perfect introduction to this increasingly popular scripting language. Written by two leading Python trainers, this book covers the core concepts of the language. Each chapter contains many examples and ends with a set of exercises. Because Python can be run interactively, the reader can run the examples and exercises on any system where Python is installed. Suggested solutions to all the exercises are in the back of the book, making it an excellent teaching and leaming tool. This book provides a description of the basic building blocks of a Python program : types, operators, statements, functions, modules, classes, and exceptions. In addition, the book introduces more advanced topics, including some complex, real-world examples. Finally, it shows programmers how to use Python with specialized libraries to build large-scale applications, including a substantial program written in JPython. For simple scripts or complex scientific, web, database, graphics, and animation programs, Python is proving to be a powerful and convenient tool. With Learning Python, programmers can learn to use this language quickly and efficiently.",http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=k3eqQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781565924642&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

JavaScript,The Good Parts,Douglas Crockford,9780596517748,QA76.73.J39 C763 2008,2008-12-08,"Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

Program development in Java,"abstraction, specification, and object-oriented design","B. Liskov, John Guttag",9780201657685,QA76.73.J38 L58 2000,2001,"Written by a world-renowned expert on programming methodology, and the winner of the 2008 Turing Award, this book shows how to build production-quality programs--programs that are reliable, easy to maintain, and quick to modify. Its emphasis is on modular program construction: how to get the modules right and how to organize a program as a collection of modules. The book presents a methodology effective for either an individual programmer, who may be writing a small program or a single module in a larger o≠ or a software engineer, who may be part of a team developing a complex program comprised of many modules. Both audiences will acquire a solid foundation for object-oriented program design and component-based software development from this methodology. Because each module in a program corresponds to an abstraction, such as a collection of documents or a routine to search the collection for documents of interest, the book first explains the kinds of abstractions most useful to programmers: procedures; iteration abstractions; and, most critically, data abstractions. Indeed, the author treats data abstraction as the central paradigm in object-oriented program design and implementation. The author also shows, with numerous examples, how to develop informal specifications that define these abstractions--specifications that describe what the modules do--and then discusses how to implement the modules so that they do what they are supposed to do with acceptable performance. Other topics discussed include: Encapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the behavior defined by the specification Tradeoffs between simplicity and performance Techniques to help readers of code understand and reason about it, focusing on such properties as rep invariants and abstraction functions Type hierarchy and its use in defining families of related data abstractions Debugging, testing, and requirements analysis Program design as a top-down, iterative process, and design patterns The Java programming language is used for the book's examples. However, the techniques presented are language independent, and an introduction to key Java concepts is included for programmers who may not be familiar with the language.",http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&source=gbs_api,http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=o7RQAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780201657685&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api
