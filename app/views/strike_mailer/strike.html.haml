      You have recieved a strike for the following reason:
      %b
        = @strike.other_info
      \. You currently have
      = pluralize(@user.strikes.count, 'strike')
      \. If you recieve
      = pluralize(Rails.configuration.strikes_for_ban, 'strike')
      , you will be banned from the system.
